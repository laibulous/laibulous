### Heyaa! 👋

I'm Laiba Nadeem!🦄 A lifelong learner with a passion for tech👩🏼‍💻, I'm currently exploring various fields like programming🖥️, data analysis🔍, prompt engineering🔨, UI/UX design🏡, and Web3🌐. While I enjoy coding in C++ and Python, I'm also venturing into Java, HTML, and CSS✨.

Beyond tech, I'm drawn to poetry✒️. Though not artistically inclined myself, I enjoy engaging in discussions about art🎨. As an INFP bibliophile📚, I find peace in books, and the recent novel I've read, "The Alchemist"⚗️ has left me eager to share my thoughts💭. Although I wouldn't call myself a programming expert👩🏼‍💻, I've learned that consistency is key🗝️. That's why I'm aiming to make coding a daily habit.

Looking forward to seeing where this journey of exploration takes me!
